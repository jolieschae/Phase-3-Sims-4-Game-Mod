Hello, this repository was made for a class project in which 2 students agreed in making a custom mod for the Sims4(EA). In the process of doing so, they found that not only would it have been nearly impossible with their present programming skills, but also that the process of creating mods for the Sims4 was made easier through applications that were developed by other individuals. This respository includes the data that was decompiled using LuquanLi's Sims4 Decompiler/Mod Creator. We also used cmarNYC's s4pe to decompile the mods that we made to analyze the code and XML. A Full guide can be found on their github at https://github.com/LuquanLi/TheSims4ScriptModBuilder
